# Browser Automation with Selenium

Using Selenium to automate repetitive administrative tasks.


## Usage

Given that this script was written specifically for an online tool not accessible to the public, it is not recommended that it be used as-is. If you'd like to use it for its primary functionalities or as boilerplate code, you can still run the script in a CLI using:

```
python URL_manager_automation_11.26.18.py
```


## Built With

* [Selenium WebDriver](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/api.html) - Used for browser automation
* [GetPass](https://docs.python.org/2/library/getpass.html) - For prompting the user for a password without echoing
